# Create: OneBlock

A Minecraft map originally made by [IJAminecraft](https://ijaminecraft.com/map/oneblock/), which was adapted for 1.20.1 by [Gamerz_Riot](https://www.youtube.com/@Gamerz_Riot) and then finally modified by [samadc](https://sradcock.com) for the Create mod

## Datapack information:
The datapack Create_Oneblock was the datapack modified by myself but the datapack called create_copper_zinc_renewable_v1.5 was made in whole by [robinfrt](https://www.curseforge.com/members/robinfrt/projects) and has been added to make the world more playable.

## How to play:

### For singleplayer:
Drag into saves folder and right click > WinRAR or 7zip > Extract Here

### For multiplayer:
Drag into folder with server.jar (or the minecraft server jar basically) and right click > WinRAR or 7zip > Extract Here

Rename folder to 'world' and make sure that level-name=world

## Disclaimer:
The original datapack and all modifications made to it by IJAMinecraft and Gamerz_Riot, belong wholy to them. I claim ZERO ownership of their brilliant coding abilities.

[The Create: Copper & Zinc [Datapack]](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/create-copper-zinc-datapack) used is entirely also not mine and it belongs wholy to robinfrt
